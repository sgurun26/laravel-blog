# Project Description

This project is all about the full-stack blog application made with use of PHP Laravel.

# Challenges Faced and Approach
I already have the post controller so I was having difficulties when sending the posts but I managed to make new controller and successfully send the data according to api endpoints.

# Additional Feature
Tried to resolve the previous mistakes like my admin page was having auth errors as user data is not passed to view

# Project Description

This project is all about the full-stack blog application made with use of PHP Laravel.

# Challenges Faced and Approach
The first challenge was setting up mongodb with laravel. Finally I fix the issue myself after long hours. It was 
actually the php version was from laragon but whenever I install mongodb package it uses php which is from xampp in 
windows environment variable. 

Another challenge was understanding the proper flow and adding role based feature.

# Additional Feature
When user register from the builtin register page the role was automaticlly set to user

In this part only the admin and role parts was focused rather than UI.

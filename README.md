# Project Description

This project is all about the full-stack blog application made with use of PHP Laravel.

# Challenges Faced and Approach
I have never used laravel but have done Django and MERN Stack so have some problem with syntax and way of doing things. 
Here I followed the lecture tutorials and videos. Moreover, I followed the official documentation and some blog posts online.

# Additional Feature
Made some little UI than that of just following lecture videos and also edit and delete button
